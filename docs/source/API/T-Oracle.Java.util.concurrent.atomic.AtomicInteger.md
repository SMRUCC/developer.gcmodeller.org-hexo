# AtomicInteger
_namespace: [Oracle.Java.util.concurrent.atomic](N-Oracle.Java.util.concurrent.atomic.html)_

An int value that may be updated atomically. See the java.util.concurrent.atomic package specification for description of the properties of atomic variables. An AtomicInteger is used in applications such as atomically incremented counters, and cannot be used as a replacement for an Integer. However, this class does extend Number to allow uniform access by tools and utilities that deal with numerically-based classes.

### Methods

#### #ctor
```csharp
Oracle.Java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger.#ctor
```
