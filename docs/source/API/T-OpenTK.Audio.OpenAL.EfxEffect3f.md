_namespace: [OpenTK.Audio.OpenAL](N-OpenTK.Audio.OpenAL.html)_

A list of valid Math.Vector3 Effect/GetEffect parameters



### Properties

#### EaxReverbLateReverbPan
Reverb Pan does for the Reverb what Reflections Pan does for the Reflections. Unit: Vector3 of length 0f to 1f Default: {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}
#### EaxReverbReflectionsPan
This Vector3 controls the spatial distribution of the cluster of early reflections. The direction of this vector controls the global direction of the reflections, while its magnitude controls how focused the reflections are towards this direction. For legacy reasons this Vector3 follows a left-handed co-ordinate system! Note that OpenAL uses a right-handed coordinate system. Unit: Vector3 of length 0f to 1f Default: {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}
