Functions necessary to perform Weighted Correlation Network Analysis. 
 WGCNA is also known as weighted gene co-expression network analysis when dealing with gene expression data. 
 Many functions of WGCNA can also be used for general association networks specified by a symmetric adjacency matrix.
 (这只是一个WGCNA函数对象的基本类型)
